      <h2>"Can you help me?"</h2>
      <p>Thanks for your interest in working with me. Right now, I'm only working with clients on Leverage Lab and Whip It! Web Dev. Choosing to work only on what I do best means that I can get really, really good at what I do, instead of trying to be so-so at everything.</p>
      <p>What this means for you is the following: If you're looking for someone to help you with email template development, rush work, pure visual design without UX/research/discovery, print design, social media marketing, or copywriting, <strong>I can't help you with that.</strong> </p>

      <p><strong>"Can I hire you to work on a site I already have?"</strong></p>
      <p>Sure! My Leverage Lab is a way for us to work together on your current existing site. However, if you need me to make changes or do maintenance on your current site, I can't help. Leverage Lab will give you a framework for proceeding with maintance and improvements; if you need help beyond that, you're better off looking elsewhere.</p>

      <p><strong>I have more questions!</strong></p>
      <p>Sounds great! <a href="mailto:amandalee@amandalee.me" class="contact">Get in touch.</a></p>
